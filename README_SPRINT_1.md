## 📊 BEFORE → AFTER

### Report View Experience

**BEFORE**:
```
User opens report
├── Sees static KPI numbers (no context)
├── Looks at tables (slow to parse)
├── Reads charts (takes time)
├── Can't export (must screenshot)
├── Can't see trends (no visibility)
└── Spends 30 minutes to understand
```

**AFTER**:
```
User opens report
├── Reads 1-line Executive Summary (5 sec) ✅
├── Scans trend arrows on KPI cards (5 sec) ✅
├── Views LineChart for trends (10 sec) ✅
├── Spots risks with colored badges (5 sec) ✅
├── Exports CSV with 1 click (1 sec) ✅
└── Spends 5 minutes with full understanding ✅
```

**Time Saved**: 25 minutes per report = 2+ hours per week for management team!
